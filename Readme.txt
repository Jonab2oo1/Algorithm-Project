Project Name: Network Flow
Programming Language: python

Project Idea: 
This project displays three algorithms with three data structures for each algorithm 
that solve the Max Flow Problem in visualization form using python language .

How to Open  the Project: 
- Open the folder ðŸ“‚"Algo_Project"
- This folder also contain three folder and inside each folder there are code file,data file and REPORT for project. 
- The first folder is "Algo_Dinic's" which is contained three data structures (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matris and Graph)
  In the "Adjacency List" Algorithm there are some Classes(Node,LinkedList,Graph) and ask user how many vertices want to read form file.
  In the "Adjacency Matrix" Algorithm there are some Methods(add_vertex,add_edge,print_graph, read_graph, Extract, Bfs, dfs and MaxFlow)
  In the "Graph" Algorithm there are some Methods in Class "Dinic"(create_graph,overlap of "bfs" method and MaxFlow)
- The second folder is "Algo_Edmonds-Karp" which is contained three data structures (2D Array & Queue, 2D Array & stack and Graph & Queue)
  In the "2D Array and Queue" Algorithm there are two Method(edmonds_karp and bfs).
  In the "2D Array and stack" Algorithm also has two methods (Bfs and MaxFlow).
  In the "Graph and Queue" Algorithm there are some Methods in Class in class "Graph"(BFS and FordFulkerson)
- The Third folder is "Algo_Ford-Fulkerson" which are contained three data structures (Adjacency List, Adjacency Array and Graph)
  In the "Adjacency_Array" Algorithm there are some Classes(edge , Graph and ford_fulkerson).
  In the "Adjacency_List" Algorithm there are some methods and classes(Bfs and MaxFlow).
  In the "Graph" Algorithm there are two Class(Edge and FlowNetwork)


NOTE: 
This project to read BIG DATA more than 120thousand data then it calculates 
the runtime for each Algorithm with different Data Structures and compares them.
